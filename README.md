Hi,
I am Reyansh Batra. 
This is my first website, for reference I am still in my teenage (yes, I am a kid). I am currently learning Java, Linux, and some other server stuff. I created this repo so I can refresh my HTML skills, so don't take this website too 
seriously.   --->  https://reyanshbatra.github.io/mywebsitefr/

[This website is still under construction and will be updated regularly, except in exams and vacations]
